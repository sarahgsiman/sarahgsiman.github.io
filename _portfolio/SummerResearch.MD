**Over the summer of 2022, I worked in the [Macdonald Group](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/chemistry/groups/macdonald/index.html) at Vanderbilt's Department of Chemistry on an independent research project.**

# The Vision

* The Anishinaabe people are an indigenous cultural group located in the area surrounding the Great Lakes. Vibrant red paintings on the faces of cliffs overlooking the Great Lakes have been created by members of this culture, some of which have lasted for over 2,000 years (while modern grafitti on the cliffs washes off after a season). Unfortunately, the methods of creating the pigments and painting the cliffs have been lost.
* The pigment is made of iron oxide, and the cliff faces are covered in a layer of silica. The paintings have survived centuries of exposure to rainwater, lake levels rising, winds, and the rest of the elements. Despite all of this, the bonds between the iron oxide and silica are so strong, the paintings survive. The purpose of my investigation was to study the silica-iron oxide bonds and understand what causes them to be so durable-- with the eventual goal of gaining more insight into how the Anishinaabe people created their paints.

# The Project

* I needed to first simulate the application of pigment onto the rock face, and then simulate rainfall hitting the painted rocks. I used iron oxide powder in solutions at different pHs and attemped a few different methods of applying the iron oxide to microscope slides (silica). Once I found the best application method, it was time to "wash" them.
* Using an upside-down Buchner funnel and a test tube rack, I created a standardized way to evenly distribute "rain" onto the microscope slides. After many repeated trials and slight changes to the procedure, I was able to pinpoint the conditions that most affected the durability of the bonds. The poster below goes into further detail.

# Poster
I presented the poster below at Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE) REU's summer poster session and won Fan Favorite.
