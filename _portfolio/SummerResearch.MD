# The Vision

* The Anishinaabe people are an indigenous cultural group located in the area surrounding the Great Lakes. Vibrant red paintings on the faces of cliffs overlooking the Great Lakes have been created by members of this culture, some of which have lasted for over 2,000 years (while modern grafitti on the cliffs washes off after a season). Unfortunately, the methods of creating the pigments and painting the cliffs have been lost.
* The pigment is made of iron oxide, and the cliff faces are covered in a layer of silica. The paintings have survived centuries of exposure to rainwater, lake levels rising, winds, and the rest of the elements. Despite all of this, the bonds between the iron oxide and silica are so strong, the paintings survive. The purpose of my investigation was to study the silica-iron oxide bonds and understand what causes them to be so durable-- with the eventual goal of gaining more insight into how the Anishinaabe people created their paints.
